# DATA ACQUISITION 
This file contains the original data files for all data used in this 
analysis. When there were not spreadsheets available to be downloaded as 
raw files, I created an excel sheet and copied the information into that 
spreadsheet. The files in which this occurred are clearly noted below and 
any modifications to tidy the data are clearly noted. 

**DOWNLOADED DATA SETS** 
**Watts, D. P. (2020). Meat eating by nonhuman primates: a review and 
synthesis. Journal of human evolution, 149, 102882.**

There was not a dataset available to download for the above article. This 
data was copied into an excel spreadsheet. The following modifications 
were made to enhance usability of this data: 
1) Some species rows had blank spaces where the prey order and family were 
inferred to be the taxonomy specified above. I input the prey order and 
family when appropriate informationw as given in the source column. I did 
not add any specifications when the source did not give further 
identifyign information. 
2) Some names had astrichs beside them. These astricts were removed. 
3) In the chimpanzee predator rows, the prey order column listed primates, 
rather than mammalia. In order to maintain consistency, I adjusted this 
taxonomy so all primate prey were listed as mammalia in the prey column, 
primates in the order column, and the appropriate family for each primate 
given in the family column.

size is predicted by diet but not sociality. Nature ecology & evolution,

This data set was downloaded on 03/26/23 from its supplemental file 
format. No changes were made.
